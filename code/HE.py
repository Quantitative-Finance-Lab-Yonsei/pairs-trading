# Break the time series into chunks.

# In each chunk:

# Compute the mean and subtract it.

# Compute the cumulative deviation (like a walk).

# Find the range (max - min of cumulative sum).

# Divide by the standard deviation.

# Plot log(R/S) vs log(n) (window size).

# The slope of the line is the Hurst exponent!
